## Medical-Diff-VQA Dataset 
The Medical-Diff-VQA (originally MIMIC-Diff-VQA) dataset can be downloaded from Physionet (currently under review. will be available soon). The code used for generating the dataset can be found in the [Medical-Diff-VQA repository](https://github.com/Holipori/MIMIC-Diff-VQA).

## Our Model
This repository contains two main folders. The [feature extraction](./feature%20extraction) folder contains the code for extracting the image features. The [model](./model) folder contains the code for training and testing our model. Please refer to the README.md in each folder for more details.
